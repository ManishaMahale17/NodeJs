 Handling HTTP requests:
 <!-- The Built-in HTTP Module
Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

To include the HTTP module, use the require() method:

var http = require('http'); 

The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:

ExampleGet your own Node.js Server
var http = require('http');

//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
  res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
-->
nodemon
<!-- nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. -->
