<!-- Software testing can be stated as the process of verifying and validating whether a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases. -->
1. Manual Testing: 
<!-- Manual testing includes testing software manually, i.e., without using any automation tool or any script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug. -->
Automation Testing:
<!--
 the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product
automation testing is also used to test the application from a load, performance, and stress point of view. 
It increases the test coverage, improves accuracy, and saves time and money when compared to manual testing.  -->

mocha and chai(assertion libraries) are libraries that use to writes tests cases.
--
npm init -y
npm i chai
npm i mocha
npm i express
npm i jsonwebtoken
<!-- in package.json
"scripts:"
"start":"nodemon index.js"
"test":"mocha"
 -->

What are different levels of software testing? 


1. Unit Testing: 
<!-- A level of the software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.  -->

2. Integration Testing: 
<!-- A level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.  -->

3. System Testing: 
<!-- A level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.  -->

4. Acceptance Testing: 
<!-- A level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.  -->
