What is a REST API?
<!-- A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. 
Why is REST API used?
One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.
