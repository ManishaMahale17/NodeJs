      /*Coding Challenge #2 
        Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it. 
        Your tasks: 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. 
        The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!" 2.
         Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.
          Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" 
        Hint: Use an if/else statement 😉 
         */
      let heightMark = 1.69
      let weightMark = 78
      let BMIMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2

      let heightJohn = 1.95
      let weightJohn = 92
      let BMIJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2

      if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
        console.log(
          `Mark's BMI ${BMIMark} is higher than John's BMI ${BMIJohn}`,
